## Introduction

This is a C++ program that allows users to keep track of a list of integers. The program allows users to perform a variety of operations on the list such as adding numbers, printing numbers, displaying the mean, smallest and largest numbers in the list, and quitting the program.
## Prerequisites

    A C++ compiler (e.g. GCC, Clang, Visual Studio)
    A command line interface (CLI) or terminal
    Basic knowledge of C++

## Getting Started

    Download the program's source code.
    Open a command line interface or terminal in the directory where the source code is located.
    Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, you can use the following command: g++ main.cpp -o main
    Run the program by typing ./main in the command line interface or terminal.

## Installing

You don't need to install the program. You only need to download the source code and compile it using your preferred C++ compiler.
Using the Program

When you run the program, it will display a menu with the following options:

    P - Print numbers
    A - Add numbers
    M - Display the mean of the numbers
    S - Display the smallest number
    L - Display the largest number
    Q - Quit

You can use the following examples to understand how to interact with the program:

    To add a number to the list, type A and then enter the number you want to add. For example:

```Enter your choice: A
Enter an integer to add to the list: 5

5 added

    To print the numbers in the list, type P. For example:

Enter your choice: P

[ 5 ]

    To display the mean of the numbers in the list, type M. For example:

Enter your choice: M

The mean is: 5

    To display the smallest number in the list, type S. For example:

Enter your choice: S

The smallest number is: 5

    To display the largest number in the list, type L. For example:

Enter your choice: L

The largest number is: 5

    To quit the program, type Q.
