# Secure Encryption and Decryption App

This is a simple command-line application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom character set and a key.
Getting Started

To use the app, simply clone or download the repository, and run the program in your C++ compiler.
Prerequisites

    C++ compiler (e.g. GCC, Visual Studio)

## Installing

To run the program, open the .cpp file in your C++ compiler and build the program.
Using the App

When the program is run, it will prompt you to enter 'E' to encrypt a message or 'D' to decrypt a message. After entering your choice, you will be prompted to enter the message you wish to encrypt or decrypt. The program will then display the encrypted or decrypted message.

For example:

    If you want to encrypt the message "Hello World", you would enter 'E' when prompted, then enter "Hello World" when prompted for the message. The program will then display the encrypted message: "Khoor#Zruog"
    If you want to decrypt the message "Khoor#Zruog", you would enter 'D' when prompted, then enter "Khoor#Zruog" when prompted for the message. The program will then display the decrypted message: "Hello World"

Note: The program uses a custom character set and a key of '3' to encrypt and decrypt messages.
